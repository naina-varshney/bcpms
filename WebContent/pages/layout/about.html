                        Banasthali Vidyapith is a fully residential women's higher education institute which offers an integrated system 
                        extending from the primary to the Ph.D. level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It was on October 6, 1935 that Smt. Ratan Shastri and Pandit Hiralal Shastri founded Banasthali to fill up the 
                        vacuum caused by the sudden death of their highly talented and promising daughter Shantabai. They had high expectations
                        that she would work for women's cause when she would grow up. But  destiny  ordained  otherwise.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Thus, Banasthali  owes its existence neither to the zeal of an educationist, nor to that of a social reformer. It is also
                        not the creation of a Philanthropist's purse. It has arisen like the fabled phoenix from the ashes of a blossoming flower 
                        Shantabai.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Banasthali is one of the five higher education institute in India meant exclusively for Women. Over these seventy five years
                        Banasthali has developed into a National Centre for women's education. Banasthali's educational programme aims at an all-round 
                        development of student's personality. To achieve its objective of 'synthesis of spiritual values and scientific achievements of 
                        the East and the West',it has evolved Five-fold Educational Programme (Panchmukhi Shiksha) comprising of  the following aspects : 
                        <p>(i) Physical, 
                            (ii) Practical, 
                        (iii) Aesthetic, 
                        (iv) Moral and 
                        (v) Intellectual.
                        </p>
                        This way the students develop an integrated and balanced personality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The rural ambience of Banasthali Vidyapith is very conducive for promoting 
                        the ideology of simple living, and for imbibing and internalizing the values of self-reliance and tolerance. Following the 
                        philosophy of the balanced Panchmukhi system of education, the institute provides ample opportunities for integrated development 
                        of the personality. The stress on the positive aspects of the Indian heritage has resulted in a climate which has contributed 
                        significantly to the task of the upliftment of women to enable them to take on leadership roles with confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This institute has made full use of the autonomy provided under the deemed university status and has innovatively restructured the courses offered
                        which include subjects ranging from the traditional as well tthe emerging areas to the highest level of research (leading to the doctoral degree). 
                        Banasthali has been accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with 'A' Grade (Five star Rating). Banasthali is a recipient of SANTBAL Award in the year 2000 for the services in the field of all round education of women.
